Information

**Dataset**: [Combined Cycle Power Plant Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/294/combined+cycle+power+plant)

**Dataset Information**: The dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant.

**Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP)**: A CCPP is composed of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST) and heat recovery steam generators. In a CCPP, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines, which are combined in one cycle, and is transferred from one turbine to another. While the Vacuum is collected from and has an effect on the Steam Turbine, the other three ambient variables affect the GT performance.

**Machine Learning Model**: Extreme Gradient Boosting Algorithm with an accuracy of 97%
